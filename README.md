# Fotomat

# This was a Codecademy project for their Front-end engineering career path 

# Description: 
  In this project you will fix a broken version of a responsive website called Fotomatic. 
  You will update it to look and work exactly the same as the specs 
  (https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/capstone-1/specs/fotomatic_spec_landing.png) 
  do.
  
  As you fix Fotomatic’s bugs, remember to use the skills you acquired in the Chrome DevTools 
  article to help you decipher and update the site’s CSS. Chrome DevTools are essential for 
  debugging – they allow you to view current style values, toggle rules, and test different 
  rule values.

 All the changes I made can be found in index.html and style.css files. Index.html file is 
 available inside the repository whereas you can fins the css file in resources -> css -> style.css. 
 PLEASE READ THE COMMENTS IN THESE FILES as they are as descriptive as I could make them, and I have also explained 
 where I have made the changes, how they will affect the page, and I also made the code simpler to 
 understand (at least for me).

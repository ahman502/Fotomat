# Fotomat

# This was a Codecademy project for their Front-end engineering career path 

# Description: 
  In this project you will fix a broken version of a responsive website called Fotomatic. 
  You will update it to look and work exactly the same as the specs 
  (https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/capstone-1/specs/fotomatic_spec_landing.png) 
  do.
  
  As you fix Fotomatic’s bugs, remember to use the skills you acquired in the Chrome DevTools 
  article to help you decipher and update the site’s CSS. Chrome DevTools are essential for 
  debugging – they allow you to view current style values, toggle rules, and test different 
  rule values.
